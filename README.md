# Metaphor Detection 
Metaphor detection in Bhagavad Gita and Sermon on the Mount using BERT-based models<br>

## OVERVIEW
This is a study to understand and evaluate translations of the Bhagavad Gita and Sermon on the Mount which are important religious texts in Hinduism and Christianity respectively. The use of metaphors and associated literary devices have been central to the composition of ancient religious and philosophical texts. We performed metaphor detection for different translations of the Bhagavad Gita and Sermon on the Mount using BERT-based model XLM-R (RoBERTa).
